This causes issues for me since I use an auto-generated api client which will error out in case it receives something _not string-like_ - in this case e.g. a number as id.\r\n\r\nAnother similar issue has been opened here already: https://github.com/netbox-community/go-netbox/issues/133\r\n\r\nWhat can we do about that? :)\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nCorrect type stated in swagger.yml\n\n### Observed Behavior\n\nIncorrect type stated in swagger.yml\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"netbox/utilities/forms/utils.py\",\n    \"netbox/ipam/models/ip.py\",\n    \"netbox/netbox/configuration_example.py\",\n    \"netbox/utilities/utils.py\",\n    \"netbox/extras/models/customfields.py\",\n    \"netbox/users/models.py\",\n    \"netbox/utilities/forms/widgets.py\",\n    \"netbox/utilities/forms/fields/dynamic.py\",\n    \"netbox/extras/scripts.py\",\n    \"netbox/dcim/models/devices.py\",\n    \"netbox/ipam/tables/ip.py\",\n    \"netbox/ipam/lookups.py\",\n    \"netbox/netbox/tables/columns.py\",\n    \"netbox/extras/plugins/__init__.py\",\n    \"netbox/netbox/api/fields.py\",\n    \"netbox/dcim/forms/models.py\",\n    \"netbox/ipam/api/views.py\",\n    \"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\",\n    \"netbox/extras/models/models.py\",\n    \"netbox/utilities/permissions.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\", \"netbox/ipam/api/views.py\", \"netbox/ipam/models/ip.py\", \"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\", \"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\", \"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\", \"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"netbox/ipam/api/serializers.py\", \"netbox/ipam/api/views.py\", \"netbox/ipam/models/ip.py\", \"netbox/utilities/forms/utils.py\", \"netbox/netbox/configuration_example.py\", \"netbox/utilities/utils.py\", \"netbox/extras/models/customfields.py\", \"netbox/users/models.py\", \"netbox/utilities/forms/widgets.py\", \"netbox/utilities/forms/fields/dynamic.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 10 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "netbox-community__netbox__83db8d207208d9abe88a038f6114fc3247d163e5_32", "ts": "2025-10-19T14:28:40.641983+00:00"}
