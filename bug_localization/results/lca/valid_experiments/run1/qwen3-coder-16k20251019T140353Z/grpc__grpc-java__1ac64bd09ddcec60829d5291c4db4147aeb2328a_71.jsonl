But `finishStream()` [calls transportReportStatus() without any lock held](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java#L463). That is not synchronized correctly, as `transportReportStatus()` may only be called from the transport thread (i.e., while `lock` is held).\n\nIt seems that all usages of `streams` is done while `lock` is held except for within `finishStream()` and [data()](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java#L570). `data()` can actually race with `finishStream()` and end up sending DATA frames after the RST_STREAM.
