I ran into this as part of upgrading to Spring Camden.RELEASE (that updates from spring-cloud-consul 1.0.2 to 1.1.0).\n\nI did some debugging and think I know what the root cause is:\n- ConfigWatch always a trailing slash to the context paths looked at in Consul\n- This essentially means that ConfigWatch always looks at folders - this is conceptually incorrect  'FILES' mode - this actually is the problem root cause\n- Watching this incorrect path always leads to a HTTP 404 from Consul (since the file is no folder but a leaf in the Consul tree)\n- This still worked with Brixton / 1.0.2 by accident since 1.02 did not even look at the response code and only at the index returned by Consul\n- Release 1.1 added code in ConfigWatch that looks at the Consul response value and ignores HTTP 404 responses (which is correct)\n- Any changes to the config files are now skipped with Camden / 1.1.0 and do not lead to config change events\n\nThe fix would require to look at the configured config format `spring.cloud.consul.config.format` and avoid implicitly adding a trailing slash in case `FILES` is desired.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConsulConfigProperties.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConsulPropertySource.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-discovery/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/discovery/ConsulDiscoveryProperties.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConsulPropertySourceLocator.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-binder/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/binder/EventService.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-discovery/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/discovery/ConsulCatalogWatch.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-discovery/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/discovery/HeartbeatProperties.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-discovery/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/discovery/configclient/ConsulConfigServerAutoConfiguration.java\",\n    \"spring-cloud-consul-discovery/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/discovery/TtlScheduler.java\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\", \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\", \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConsulConfigProperties.java\", \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\", \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\", \"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"spring-cloud-consul-config/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/consul/config/ConfigWatch.java\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "spring-cloud__spring-cloud-consul__ee007651e58fc2530b5f893c1477afb3d78c7d24_97", "ts": "2025-09-30T13:15:11.453205+00:00"}
