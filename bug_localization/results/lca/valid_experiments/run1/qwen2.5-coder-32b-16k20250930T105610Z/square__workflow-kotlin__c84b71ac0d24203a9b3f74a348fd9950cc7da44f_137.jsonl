The workflow tree is seeded with\n * [initialSnapshot] and the current value value of [props].

The current value of the [props] [StateFlow] is used to perform the initial render\n * pass. The result of this render pass is used to initialize the [StateFlow] of renderings and\n * snapshots that is returned.\n *\n * Once the initial render pass is complete, the workflow runtime will continue executing in a new\n * coroutine launched in [scope].\n *\n * ## Scoping\n *\n * The workflow runtime makes use of\n * [structured concurrency](https://medium.com/@elizarov/structured-concurrency-722d765aa952).\n *\n * The runtime is started in [scope], which defines the context for the entire workflow tree – most\n * importantly, the [Job] that governs the runtime's lifetime and exception\n * reporting path, and the [CoroutineDispatcher][kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineDispatcher] that\n * decides on what thread(s) to run workflow code. Note that if the scope's dispatcher executes\n * on threads different than the caller, then the initial render pass will occur on the current\n * thread but all subsequent render passes, and actions, will be executed on that dispatcher. This\n * shouldn't affect well-written workflows, since the render method should not perform side effects\n * anyway.\n *\n * All workers that are run by this runtime will be collected in coroutines that are children of\n * [scope]. When the root workflow emits an output, [onOutput] will be invoked in a child of\n * [scope].\n *\n * To stop the workflow runtime, simply cancel [scope].

This\n * shouldn't affect well-written workflows, since the render method should not perform side effects\n * anyway.\n *\n * All workers that are run by this runtime will be collected in coroutines that are children of\n * [scope]. When the root workflow emits an output, [onOutput] will be invoked in a child of\n * [scope].\n *\n * To stop the workflow runtime, simply cancel [scope].
