If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment requires amsmath package\"\r\n\r\n### System:\r\nWindows 11, MikTex, IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1, TexiFy IDEA 0.7.28\r\n</div>\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment requires amsmath package\"\r\n\r\n### System:\r\nWindows 11, MikTex, IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1, TexiFy IDEA 0.7.28\r\n</div>\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment requires amsmath package\"\r\n\r\n### System:\r\nWindows 11, MikTex, IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1, TexiFy IDEA 0.7.28\r\n</div>\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment

If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment requires amsmath package\"\r\n\r\n### System:\r\nWindows 11, MikTex, IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1, TexiFy IDEA 0.7.28\r\n</div>\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following

required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...],
