If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers.

I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally.

For this reason, I am using 301 redirects, which I don't know is the best idea.\n\nI was reading the description for 307 redirect at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n\n---\n\n10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect\n\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. \nSince the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD \ncontinue to use the Request-URI for future requests. \nThis response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.\n\n---\n\nAt http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html,\n\n---\n\n13.4 - Response Cacheability\n\nA response received with a status code of 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410 \nMAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, \nsubject to the expiration mechanism, unless a cache-control directive \nprohibits caching. However, a cache that does not support the Range and \nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\n\nA response received with any other status code \n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\n\n---\n\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven't tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp's CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\n\n---\n\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\n    // This implementation doesn't support caching partial content.\n    int responseCode = response.code();\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\n    return false;\n}\n\n---\n\nAnd to verify that caching isn't enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\n\n---\n\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\n  assertCached(false, i);\n}\n\n---\n\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn't redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn't be a problem through Amazon.

For this reason, I am using 301 redirects, which I don\\'t know is the best idea.\\n\\nI was reading the description for 307 redirect at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\\n\\n---\\n\\n10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect\\n\\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. \\nSince the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD \\ncontinue to use the Request-URI for future requests. \\nThis response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAt http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html,\\n\\n---\\n\\n13.4 - Response Cacheability\\n\\nA response received with a status code of 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410 \\nMAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, \\nsubject to the expiration mechanism, unless a cache-control directive \\nprohibits caching. However, a cache that does not support the Range and \\nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\\n\\nA response received with any other status code \\n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \\na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \\nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \\nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \\n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \\ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven\\'t tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp\\'s CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\\n\\n---\\n\\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\\n    // This implementation doesn\\'t support caching partial content.\\n    int responseCode = response.code();\\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\\n    return false;\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd to verify that caching isn\\'t enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\\n\\n---\\n\\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\\n  assertCached(false, i);\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\\n\\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don\\'t have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn\\'t redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn\\'t be a problem through Amazon.

However, a cache that does not support the Range and \\nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\\n\\nA response received with any other status code \\n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \\na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \\nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \\nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \\n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \\ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven\\'t tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp\\'s CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\\n\\n---\\n\\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\\n    // This implementation doesn\\'t support caching partial content.\\n    int responseCode = response.code();\\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\\n    return false;\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd to verify that caching isn\\'t enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\\n\\n---\\n\\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\\n  assertCached(false, i);\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\\n\\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don\\'t have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn\\'t redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn\\'t be a problem through Amazon.

I am using retrofit and okhttp in my Android app to download documents, images and music files. The files are hosted on Amazon through a CDN so the URLs change often. My backend server will try to use redirects to decrease the need to have to constantly update my content on my mobile app every time the CDN url changes. The devices should also cache responses in the case that the device is offline. For this reason, I am using 301 redirects, which I don\\'t know is the best idea.\\n\\nI was reading the description for 307 redirect at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\\n\\n---\\n\\n10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect\\n\\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. \\nSince the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD \\ncontinue to use the Request-URI for future requests. \\nThis response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAt http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html,\\n\\n---\\n\\n13.4 - Response Cacheability\\n\\nA response received with a status code of 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410 \\nMAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, \\nsubject to the expiration mechanism, unless a cache-control directive \\nprohibits caching. However, a cache that does not support the Range and \\nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\\n\\nA response received with any other status code \\n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \\na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \\nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \\nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \\n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \\ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven\\'t tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp\\'s CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\\n\\n---\\n\\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\\n    // This implementation doesn\\'t support caching partial content.\\n    int responseCode = response.code();\\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\\n    return false;\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd to verify that caching isn\\'t enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\\n\\n---\\n\\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\\n  assertCached(false, i);\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\\n\\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers.

However, a cache that does not support the Range and \nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\n\nA response received with any other status code \n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\n\n---\n\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible.

I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally.

I am using retrofit and okhttp in my Android app to download documents, images and music files. The files are hosted on Amazon through a CDN so the URLs change often. My backend server will try to use redirects to decrease the need to have to constantly update my content on my mobile app every time the CDN url changes. The devices should also cache responses in the case that the device is offline. For this reason, I am using 301 redirects, which I don't know is the best idea.\n\nI was reading the description for 307 redirect at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n\n---\n\n10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect\n\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. \nSince the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD \ncontinue to use the Request-URI for future requests. \nThis response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.\n\n---\n\nAt http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html,\n\n---\n\n13.4 - Response Cacheability\n\nA response received with a status code of 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410 \nMAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, \nsubject to the expiration mechanism, unless a cache-control directive \nprohibits caching. However, a cache that does not support the Range and \nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\n\nA response received with any other status code \n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\n\n---\n\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven't tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp's CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\n\n---\n\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\n    // This implementation doesn't support caching partial content.\n    int responseCode = response.code();\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\n    return false;\n}\n\n---\n\nAnd to verify that caching isn't enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\n\n---\n\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\n  assertCached(false, i);\n}\n\n---\n\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn't redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn't be a problem through Amazon.

But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally.

I am using retrofit and okhttp in my Android app to download documents, images and music files. The files are hosted on Amazon through a CDN so the URLs change often. My backend server will try to use redirects to decrease the need to have to constantly update my content on my mobile app every time the CDN url changes. The devices should also cache responses in the case that the device is offline. For this reason, I am using 301 redirects, which I don't know is the best idea.\n\nI was reading the description for 307 redirect at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n\n---\n\n10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect\n\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. \nSince the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD \ncontinue to use the Request-URI for future requests. \nThis response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.\n\n---\n\nAt http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html,\n\n---\n\n13.4 - Response Cacheability\n\nA response received with a status code of 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410 \nMAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, \nsubject to the expiration mechanism, unless a cache-control directive \nprohibits caching. However, a cache that does not support the Range and \nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\n\nA response received with any other status code \n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\n\n---\n\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven't tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp's CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\n\n---\n\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\n    // This implementation doesn't support caching partial content.\n    int responseCode = response.code();\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\n    return false;\n}\n\n---\n\nAnd to verify that caching isn't enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\n\n---\n\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\n  assertCached(false, i);\n}\n\n---\n\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn't redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn't be a problem through Amazon.

For example, these include the \\nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \\n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \\ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven\\'t tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp\\'s CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\\n\\n---\\n\\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\\n    // This implementation doesn\\'t support caching partial content.\\n    int responseCode = response.code();\\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\\n    return false;\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd to verify that caching isn\\'t enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\\n\\n---\\n\\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\\n  assertCached(false, i);\\n}\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\\n\\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don\\'t have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn\\'t redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn\\'t be a problem through Amazon. Could you provide some advice in this scenario?'}\n</args>\n\nYou have access to the following tools: \n* get_bm25_top10() -> Retrieve the top-10 best results with BM25 search. *\n* get_bm25_top20() -> Retrieve the top-20 best results with BM25 search.*\n* get_bm25_top30() -> Retrieve the top-30 best results with BM25 search. *\n \nIf you are done, provide your final ranked list of 1 files most likely to contain bugs in a JSON array as follows: {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...]}\nOtherwise, return only the tool call as JSON.

For this reason, I am using 301 redirects, which I don't know is the best idea.\n\nI was reading the description for 307 redirect at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\n\n---\n\n10.3.8 307 Temporary Redirect\n\nThe requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. \nSince the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD \ncontinue to use the Request-URI for future requests. \nThis response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.\n\n---\n\nAt http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html,\n\n---\n\n13.4 - Response Cacheability\n\nA response received with a status code of 200, 203, 206, 300, 301 or 410 \nMAY be stored by a cache and used in reply to a subsequent request, \nsubject to the expiration mechanism, unless a cache-control directive \nprohibits caching. However, a cache that does not support the Range and \nContent-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial Content) responses.\n\nA response received with any other status code \n(e.g. status codes 302 and 307) MUST NOT be returned in a reply to \na subsequent request unless there are cache-control directives or another \nheader(s) that explicitly allow it. For example, these include the \nfollowing: an Expires header (section 14.21); a \"max-age\", \"s-maxage\", \n\"must- revalidate\", \"proxy-revalidate\", \"public\" or \"private\" \ncache-control directive (section 14.9).\n\n---\n\nIt seems that the description states that caching is possible. I haven't tried this yet, but I did notice that in okhttp's CacheStrategy.java class, it has the following code:\n\n---\n\npublic static boolean isCacheable(Response response, Request request) {\n    // Always go to network for uncacheable response codes (RFC 2616, 13.4),\n    // This implementation doesn't support caching partial content.\n    int responseCode = response.code();\n    if (responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK // 200\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_NOT_AUTHORITATIVE // 203\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MULT_CHOICE // 300\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM / 301\n        && responseCode != HttpURLConnection.HTTP_GONE) { // 410\n    return false;\n}\n\n---\n\nAnd to verify that caching isn't enabled for from 302-308, the unit tests from CacheTest.java states the following\n\n---\n\nfor (int i = 302; i <= 308; ++i) {\n  assertCached(false, i);\n}\n\n---\n\nSo the okhttp code explicitly ignores caching for 307, and also 302. I just wanted clarification for this. Is the spec for 307 wrong? Or is something wrong with caching 307 that it was deliberately excluded? If I were to set my own cache headers for 307, it would seem to still be skipped.\n\nJust another background information. I know Amazon will support caching with proper cache headers. But since I have to redirect through my own backend, if I don't have caching ability, my offline access to my redirect URL will not respond that I have a cached version from CDN locally. Of course, if I didn't redirect from my backend and go straight to Amazon, then caching wouldn't be a problem through Amazon. Could you provide some advice in this scenario?\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\",\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/HttpEngine.java\",\n    \"okhttp-urlconnection/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/huc/HttpURLConnectionImpl.java\",\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/Cache.java\",\n    \"samples/crawler/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/sample/Crawler.java\",\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/CacheControl.java\",\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/Response.java\",\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/OkHttpClient.java\",\n    \"okhttp-urlconnection/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/huc/JavaApiConverter.java\",\n    \"okhttp-android-support/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/huc/JavaApiConverter.java\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/Cache.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/HttpEngine.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/CacheStrategy.java\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "square__okhttp__64f2af812bef505b6cbc1693aa8b504d9dbbb42e_50", "ts": "2025-09-30T12:04:07.347962+00:00"}
