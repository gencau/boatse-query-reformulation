Create new project (MiKTeX Windows SDK (MiKTeX 21.10), Configure with BibTeX support)\r\n2. Project format .idea (directory-based)\r\n3. Add some text to the default `main.tex` file.\r\n4. Add an entry to the default `main.bib` file.\r\n5. Use the `\\\\cite{}` command in the `main.tex` file.\r\n6. Run 'main'\r\n\r\nThe result is `I couldn't open file name 'main.aux'` on the bibtex command, and undefined references in the produced PDF.  Note that the bibtex command is \r\n`bibtex -include-directory=C:/Users/User/Documents/LaTeX_Projects/bibibibib/src -include-directory=C:/Users/User/Documents/LaTeX_Projects/bibibibib/src main`\r\nIt seems to me that instead of including the src and auxil directory, the src is included twice, though I have tried running the command manually with the auxil directory included and I get the same result. Copying the `main.aux` file into the out folder makes the bibtex command work and the bibliography is printed, but the references are still undefined, copying it again after the second compilation makes the references work as well.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/LatexCompiler.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/LatexRunConfiguration.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/modules/LatexProjectGenerator.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/LatexCommandLineState.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/ui/LatexSettingsEditor.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/action/DeleteGeneratedFiles.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/files/PsiFile.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/bibtex/BibtexSettingsEditor.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/file/SaveImageFromClipboardDialog.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/reference/InputFileReference.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/files/ImportPackage.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/completion/pathcompletion/LatexPathProviderBase.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/LatexOutputPath.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/ui/symbols/tools/SymbolImageGenerator.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/sumatra/SumatraAvailabilityChecker.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/settings/sdk/MiktexWindowsSdk.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/logtab/LatexOutputListener.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BiberCompiler.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/labels/ProjectLabels.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/files/FileSet.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/lang/BibtexDefaultEntryField.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/action/preview/InkscapePreviewer.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/documentation/LatexDocumentationProvider.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/files/VirtualFile.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/makeindex/RunMakeindexListener.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/ui/CreateFileDialog.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/settings/sdk/LatexSdkUtil.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/magic/CommandMagic.kt\",\n    \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/util/magic/FileMagic.kt\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/LatexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/BibtexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/LatexRunConfiguration.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/compiler/LatexCompiler.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/latex/LatexCommandLineState.kt\", \"src/nl/hannahsten/texifyidea/run/bibtex/BibtexSettingsEditor.kt\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "hannah-sten__texify-idea__16b618226609548003296f3e2f981328573d8b58_140", "ts": "2025-10-19T02:05:18.997147+00:00"}
