I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago). This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nccxt/ccxt\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago).

I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago). This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nccxt/ccxt\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago). This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nccxt/ccxt\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago). This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nccxt/ccxt\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago). This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nccxt/ccxt\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

I am sure the past versions of the ccxt.pro where extending the ccxt.async_support not the ccxt synchronous version.\r\n\r\nMy libraries:\r\npoetry show ccxt\r\n name         : ccxt                                                                                                         \r\n version      : 3.1.34                                                                                                       \r\n description  : A JavaScript / TypeScript / Python / C# / PHP cryptocurrency trading library with support for 130+ exchanges \r\n\r\ndependencies\r\n - aiodns >=1.1.1\r\n - aiohttp >=3.8\r\n - certifi >=2018.1.18\r\n - cryptography >=2.6.1\r\n - requests >=2.18.4\r\n - setuptools >=60.9.0\r\n - yarl >=1.7.2\r\n\r\nLet me add a current example with watch_trades():\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport ccxt.async_support as ccxt\r\nparams: Dict[str, Any] = dict(\r\n    apiKey=api_key,\r\n    secret=secret,\r\n    enableRateLimit=True,\r\n    newUpdates=True,\r\n)\r\nself.__conn: ccxt.Exchange = getattr(ccxt, exchange_name)(params)\r\nccxt_trades: List[Dict] = await self.__conn.watch_trades(market.symbol)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I am importing from `ccxt.async_support` I am getting the error with Binance as `exchange_name` that: \"binance watchTrades() is not supported yet\" while I understood that with the merging of the ccxt pro version into the ccxt library, the watch_* methods should have been moved into the async_support module. And I am pretty sure it was running like that till a while ago, because I have trading logs of that version, with successful trade watching :-)\r\n\r\nWhat is more strange to me now is that if I change the `import ccxt.async_support as ccxt` into `import ccxt.pro as ccxt` I am having the watch_* back and they actually work, which means I do not get the error that they aren't supported, but when inspecting those methods they seem to point me back to the synchronous version of the ccxt library and not to the ccxt.async_support which is where they are supposed to point (or at least it was like that a while ago). This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nccxt/ccxt\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

This is where it is pointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef watch_trades(self, symbol: str, since: Optional[int] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, params={}):\r\n    raise NotSupported(self.id + ' watchTrades() is not supported yet')\r\n```\r\nwhich is in `base.exchange.py::Exchange` instead of being in `async_support.base.exchange.py::Exchange` and being declared as an `async` method.\r\n\r\nThis is the issue that when running mypy on the code, I get a lot of warning that all of the watch_* method shouldn't be awaited because they are synchronous... which is wired and didn't happen before.\r\n\r\nHTH, let me know if you need more information.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"python/ccxt/base/exchange.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/pro/huobi.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/pro/bittrex.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/pro/kucoin.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/bitfinex2.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/bitfinex2.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/pro/binance.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/pro/kucoinfutures.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/okcoin.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/okcoin.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/zb.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/krakenfutures.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/bitget.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/zb.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/mexc.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/krakenfutures.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/bitget.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/mexc.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/poloniex.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/bybit.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/woo.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/poloniex.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/currencycom.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/bybit.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/huobi.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/lbank2.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/woo.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/pro/probit.py\",\n    \"python/ccxt/async_support/huobijp.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"python/ccxt/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/binance.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/huobi.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/bittrex.py\", \"python/ccxt/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/kucoin.py\", \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"python/ccxt/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/async_support/base/exchange.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/binance.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/huobi.py\", \"python/ccxt/pro/bittrex.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "ccxt__ccxt__801fc5551b3aef1fa98e4d69f7dd5e82e26194a4_7", "ts": "2025-10-18T22:12:27.177147+00:00"}
