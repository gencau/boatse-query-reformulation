After https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/8082, running `docker-compose logs` will quit with `ERROR: configured logging driver does not support reading`, if any of the services has `logging.driver: none`. I would expect:\r\n\r\n+  `docker-compose logs` (without service name) to automatically ignore those containers (like `docker-compose up`), possibly showing a warning instead of error.\r\n+ `docker-compose logs service-name` will fail if the service has `logging.driver: none`\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.28.3, build 14736152\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nDocker version 20.10.3, build 48d30b5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: openresty/openresty:alpine\r\n    logging:\r\n        driver: 'none'\r\n  echo:\r\n    image: node:alpine\r\n    command: [npx, http-echo-server]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.

After https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/8082, running `docker-compose logs` will quit with `ERROR: configured logging driver does not support reading`, if any of the services has `logging.driver: none`. I would expect:\r\n\r\n+  `docker-compose logs` (without service name) to automatically ignore those containers (like `docker-compose up`), possibly showing a warning instead of error.\r\n+ `docker-compose logs service-name` will fail if the service has `logging.driver: none`\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.28.3, build 14736152\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nDocker version 20.10.3, build 48d30b5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: openresty/openresty:alpine\r\n    logging:\r\n        driver: 'none'\r\n  echo:\r\n    image: node:alpine\r\n    command: [npx, http-echo-server]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.

After https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/8082, running `docker-compose logs` will quit with `ERROR: configured logging driver does not support reading`, if any of the services has `logging.driver: none`. I would expect:\r\n\r\n+  `docker-compose logs` (without service name) to automatically ignore those containers (like `docker-compose up`), possibly showing a warning instead of error.\r\n+ `docker-compose logs service-name` will fail if the service has `logging.driver: none`\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.28.3, build 14736152\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nDocker version 20.10.3, build 48d30b5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: openresty/openresty:alpine\r\n    logging:\r\n        driver: 'none'\r\n  echo:\r\n    image: node:alpine\r\n    command: [npx, http-echo-server]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.

After https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/8082, running `docker-compose logs` will quit with `ERROR: configured logging driver does not support reading`, if any of the services has `logging.driver: none`. I would expect:\r\n\r\n+  `docker-compose logs` (without service name) to automatically ignore those containers (like `docker-compose up`), possibly showing a warning instead of error.\r\n+ `docker-compose logs service-name` will fail if the service has `logging.driver: none`\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.28.3, build 14736152\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nDocker version 20.10.3, build 48d30b5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: openresty/openresty:alpine\r\n    logging:\r\n        driver: 'none'\r\n  echo:\r\n    image: node:alpine\r\n    command: [npx, http-echo-server]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.

After https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/8082, running `docker-compose logs` will quit with `ERROR: configured logging driver does not support reading`, if any of the services has `logging.driver: none`. I would expect:\r\n\r\n+  `docker-compose logs` (without service name) to automatically ignore those containers (like `docker-compose up`), possibly showing a warning instead of error.\r\n+ `docker-compose logs service-name` will fail if the service has `logging.driver: none`\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.28.3, build 14736152\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nDocker version 20.10.3, build 48d30b5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: openresty/openresty:alpine\r\n    logging:\r\n        driver: 'none'\r\n  echo:\r\n    image: node:alpine\r\n    command: [npx, http-echo-server]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.

After https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/8082, running `docker-compose logs` will quit with `ERROR: configured logging driver does not support reading`, if any of the services has `logging.driver: none`. I would expect:\r\n\r\n+  `docker-compose logs` (without service name) to automatically ignore those containers (like `docker-compose up`), possibly showing a warning instead of error.\r\n+ `docker-compose logs service-name` will fail if the service has `logging.driver: none`\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.28.3, build 14736152\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nDocker version 20.10.3, build 48d30b5\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  nginx:\r\n    image: openresty/openresty:alpine\r\n    logging:\r\n        driver: 'none'\r\n  echo:\r\n    image: node:alpine\r\n    command: [npx, http-echo-server]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.
