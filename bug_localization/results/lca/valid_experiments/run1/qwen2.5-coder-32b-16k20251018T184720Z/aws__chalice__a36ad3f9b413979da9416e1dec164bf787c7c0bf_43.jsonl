This was introduced in https://github.com/aws/chalice/commit/d6b22b3e8932dd588bf5110d5e5b084d246681a4 so it is a regression over the previous behavior where the subprocess inherited the environment. This matters for any setup.py file that makes use of an environment variable.\r\n\r\nInitial issue #497\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"chalice/compat.py\",\n    \"chalice/deploy/packager.py\",\n    \"chalice/config.py\",\n    \"chalice/awsclient.py\",\n    \"chalice/package.py\",\n    \"chalice/cli/__init__.py\",\n    \"chalice/deploy/deployer.py\",\n    \"chalice/pipeline.py\",\n    \"chalice/constants.py\",\n    \"chalice/local.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"chalice/deploy/packager.py\", \"chalice/package.py\", \"chalice/deploy/packager.py\", \"chalice/deploy/packager.py\", \"chalice/deploy/packager.py\", \"chalice/deploy/packager.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"chalice/deploy/packager.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "aws__chalice__a36ad3f9b413979da9416e1dec164bf787c7c0bf_43", "ts": "2025-10-18T19:32:55.109765+00:00"}
