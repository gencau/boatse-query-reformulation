Note that if the scope's dispatcher executes\n * on threads different than the caller, then the initial render pass will occur on the current\n * thread but all subsequent render passes, and actions, will be executed on that dispatcher. This\n * shouldn't affect well-written workflows, since the render method should not perform side effects\n * anyway.\n *\n * All workers that are run by this runtime will be collected in coroutines that are children of\n * [scope]. When the root workflow emits an output, [onOutput] will be invoked in a child of\n * [scope].\n *\n * To stop the workflow runtime, simply cancel [scope].
