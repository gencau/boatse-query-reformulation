Folder disappears.\r\n\r\nI retested the above with an email in it (admittedly a draft email).\r\n\r\n- Test folder with emails in it appears in K9.\r\n- Renamed test folder with email in it appears in K9.\r\n- Old test folder with email disappears from K9.\r\n- Removing test folder from gmail removes from K9 after folder refresh.\r\n\r\n**However**, i DO have existing K9 folders which don't exist on gmail any more, yet i can't delete them from K9 because there's no delete function and refresh folder list doesn't remove them. \r\n\r\n- Although there were no emails showing the redundant K9 folders, i tried \"clear local messages\", in case there was some data marked against them. This didn't help.\r\n- I've got 8 folders in K9 like this, which don't exist on gmail.\r\n- I did think about the possibility of compacting the account but i think that functionality has been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Expected behaviour**\r\nall folders that no longer exist in gmail should get removed by K9's refresh folder list action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Additional context**\r\nusing K9 v5.806 on Samsung S8 with official OTA android release 9 i.e. pie\r\n\r\nAm using IMAP for gmail to K9 operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Logs**\r\n~~didn't attach any as i get no errors~~\r\n\r\ndebug log attached for \"Refresh Folder List\" action on my the account in question.\r\n[k9-log.txt](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/files/7155866/k9-log.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nGary\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\",\n    \"app/storage/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/storage/migrations/MigrationTo76.kt\",\n    \"app/core/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mailstore/MessageStore.kt\",\n    \"mail/protocols/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapFolder.kt\",\n    \"app/k9mail-jmap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/notification/K9NotificationStrategy.kt\",\n    \"app/storage/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/storage/migrations/MigrationTo70.kt\",\n    \"app/core/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/controller/DraftOperations.kt\",\n    \"mail/common/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/ssl/LocalKeyStore.kt\",\n    \"app/core/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mailstore/SpecialFolderUpdater.kt\",\n    \"app/ui/legacy/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/ui/messagelist/DefaultFolderProvider.kt\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\", \"mail/protocols/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mail/store/imap/ImapFolder.kt\", \"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\", \"app/core/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/mailstore/SpecialFolderUpdater.kt\", \"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\", \"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\", \"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"backend/imap/src/main/java/com/fsck/k9/backend/imap/ImapSync.kt\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "thundernest__k-9__51e6820d9289973347c342cab9db763d7fcaee70_111", "ts": "2025-10-18T21:05:49.968805+00:00"}
