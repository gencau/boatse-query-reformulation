The current implementation of these stores contain overridden methods for `getSchema` but not `getOriginalSchema`. It's likely that with certain combinations of graphs and stores, the `originalSchema` field could remain `null` or be outdated. This could cause problems with the getSchema operation when used directly on the store (not wrapped) and differences between using a `Store` directly and using it through a `Graph`.\r\n\r\nInvestigate and fix any problems with Federated and Proxy Store use of `getSchema`/`getOriginalSchema`. This might be as simple as adding overridden methods for `getOriginalSchema`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSee #2791 for background.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following
