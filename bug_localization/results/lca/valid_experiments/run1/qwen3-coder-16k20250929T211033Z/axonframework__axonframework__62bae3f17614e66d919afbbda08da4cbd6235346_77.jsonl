The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\naxonframework/axonframework\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\naxonframework/axonframework\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\naxonframework/axonframework\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\naxonframework/axonframework\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/TrackingEventProcessorConfiguration.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/TrackingEventProcessor.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/pooled/PooledStreamingEventProcessor.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/tokenstore/TokenStore.java\",\n    \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\",\n    \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/DefaultConfigurer.java\",\n    \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/Configurer.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/AbstractEventProcessor.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/pooled/WorkPackage.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/StreamingEventProcessor.java\",\n    \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingConfigurer.java\",\n    \"axon-server-connector/src/main/java/org/axonframework/axonserver/connector/processor/EventProcessorControlService.java\",\n    \"disruptor/src/main/java/org/axonframework/disruptor/commandhandling/DisruptorCommandBus.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/AbstractEventBus.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/SubscribingEventProcessor.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/pooled/Coordinator.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/EventProcessor.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/tracing/Span.java\",\n    \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingConfiguration.java\",\n    \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/async/EventProcessorTask.java\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\", \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\", \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingConfiguration.java\", \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/TrackingEventProcessor.java\", \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\", \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\", \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingModule.java\", \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/TrackingEventProcessor.java\", \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/pooled/PooledStreamingEventProcessor.java\", \"messaging/src/main/java/org/axonframework/eventhandling/AbstractEventProcessor.java\", \"config/src/main/java/org/axonframework/config/EventProcessingConfiguration.java\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "axonframework__axonframework__62bae3f17614e66d919afbbda08da4cbd6235346_77", "ts": "2025-09-29T21:40:50.920317+00:00"}
