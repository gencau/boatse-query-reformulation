If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work. Is it possible to index also files located at TEXINPUTS?\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice!\r\n\r\n### Minimal Example:\r\n#### main.tex\r\n```\r\n\\\\documentclass[11pt]{scrartcl}\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{my_style}\r\n\r\n\\\\begin{document}\r\n    \\\\begin{align}\r\n        \\\\sigma = E \\\\varepsilon\r\n    \\\\end{align}\r\n\\\\end{document}\r\n```\r\n#### my_style.sty\r\n```\r\n\\\\RequirePackage{amsmath}\r\n```\r\nIf my_style.sty is in the source directory, it is linked in the margin next to the RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment requires amsmath package\"\r\n\r\n### System:\r\nWindows 11, MikTex, IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1, TexiFy IDEA 0.7.28\r\n</div>\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following

ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly
