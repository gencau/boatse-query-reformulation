But `finishStream()` [calls transportReportStatus() without any lock held](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java#L463). That is not synchronized correctly, as `transportReportStatus()` may only be called from the transport thread (i.e., while `lock` is held).\n\nIt seems that all usages of `streams` is done while `lock` is held except for within `finishStream()` and [data()](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java#L570). `data()` can actually race with `finishStream()` and end up sending DATA frames after the RST_STREAM. It seems it would be best to just have `stream` protected by `lock`, because it having its own synchronization isn't providing much benefit and isn't leading to correct code.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\",\n    \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientStream.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/ChannelImpl.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/AbstractClientStream.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/ServerImpl.java\",\n    \"netty/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/netty/NettyClientHandler.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/SerializingExecutor.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/Context.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/ClientCallImpl.java\",\n    \"core/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/AbstractStream.java\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientStream.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\", \"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"okhttp/src/main/java/io/grpc/transport/okhttp/OkHttpClientTransport.java\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "grpc__grpc-java__1ac64bd09ddcec60829d5291c4db4147aeb2328a_71", "ts": "2025-10-23T09:59:10.773607+00:00"}
