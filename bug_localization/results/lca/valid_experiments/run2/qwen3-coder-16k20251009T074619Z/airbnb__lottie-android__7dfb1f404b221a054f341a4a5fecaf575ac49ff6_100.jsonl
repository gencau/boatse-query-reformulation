If you want to render a specific\n *                 frame, you can use [LottieComposition.getFrameForProgress]. In most cases, you will want\n *                 to use one of the overloaded LottieAnimation composables that drives the animation for you.\n *                 The overloads that have isPlaying as a parameter instead of progress will drive the\n *                 animation automatically.

In cases where translucent\n *                             shapes overlap, applying opacity to a layer will be more accurate at the\n *                             expense of performance.\n *                             Note: This process is very expensive. The performance impact will be reduced\n *                             when hardware acceleration is enabled.\n * @param enableMergePaths Enables experimental merge paths support.

The only way to know if your animation will work\n *                         well with merge paths or not is to try it. If your animation has merge paths and\n *                         doesn't render correctly, please file an issue.\n * @param renderMode Allows you to specify whether you want Lottie to use hardware or software rendering.\n *                   Defaults to AUTOMATIC.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases. This happens as a result of passing `progress` to `LottieAnimation`. Even when using the function without progress, this happens internally reducing the scope of recomposition but not preventing it.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. This can be reproduced with any Lottie Compose sample using Layout Inspector in Android Studio Dolphin\r\n2. This can be benchmarked using the code in the issue above or any similar code\r\n\r\n**Sample benchmark result**\r\n\r\n- _While running minified release variant_\r\n Drawing time: 1174.3ms - Recomposition time: 979.4ms - percentage: 45.48%\r\n- _While running debug variant_\r\n Drawing time: 1369.3ms - Recomposition time: 1219ms - percentage: 47.1%\r\n- _While debugging_\r\n Drawing time: 2398.3ms - Recomposition time: 1837.2ms - percentage: 43.38%\r\n\r\n_Note:_ The percentage of recomposition time may increase if the parent composable had more code which is very
