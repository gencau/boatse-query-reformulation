I ran into this as part of upgrading to Spring Camden.RELEASE (that updates from spring-cloud-consul 1.0.2 to 1.1.0).\n\nI did some debugging and think I know what the root cause is:\n- ConfigWatch always a trailing slash to the context paths looked at in Consul\n- This essentially means that ConfigWatch always looks at folders - this is conceptually incorrect  'FILES' mode - this actually is the problem root cause\n- Watching this incorrect path always leads to a HTTP 404 from Consul (since the file is no folder but a leaf in the Consul tree)\n- This still worked with Brixton / 1.0.2 by accident since 1.02 did not even look at the response code and only at the index returned by Consul\n- Release 1.1 added code in ConfigWatch that looks at the Consul response value and ignores HTTP 404 responses (which is correct)\n- Any changes to the config files are now skipped with Camden / 1.1.0 and do not lead to config change events\n\nThe fix would require to look at the configured config format `spring.cloud.consul.config.format` and avoid implicitly adding a trailing slash in case `FILES` is desired.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following
