Create new project (MiKTeX Windows SDK (MiKTeX 21.10), Configure with BibTeX support)\r\n2. Project format .idea (directory-based)\r\n3. Add some text to the default `main.tex` file.\r\n4. Add an entry to the default `main.bib` file.\r\n5. Use the `\\\\cite{}` command in the `main.tex` file.\r\n6. Run 'main'\r\n\r\nThe result is `I couldn't open file name 'main.aux'` on the bibtex command, and undefined references in the produced PDF.  Note that the bibtex command is \r\n`bibtex -include-directory=C:/Users/User/Documents/LaTeX_Projects/bibibibib/src -include-directory=C:/Users/User/Documents/LaTeX_Projects/bibibibib/src main`\r\nIt seems to me that instead of including the src and auxil directory, the src is included twice, though I have tried running the command manually with the auxil directory included and I get the same result. Copying the `main.aux` file into the out folder makes the bibtex command work and the bibliography is printed, but the references are still undefined, copying it again after the second compilation
