such as: SQL to execute, sharding rule configuration, when exception occur etc.\r\nany table ,have Chinese is error.\r\n### Example codes for reproduce this issue (such as a github

file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural
