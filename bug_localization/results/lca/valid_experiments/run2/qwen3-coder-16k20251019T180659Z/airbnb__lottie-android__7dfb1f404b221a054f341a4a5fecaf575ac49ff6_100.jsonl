This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

To generate a [LottieComposition], you can use\n *                    [rememberLottieComposition].\n * @param progress The progress (between 0 and 1) that should be rendered. If you want to render a specific\n *                 frame, you can use [LottieComposition.getFrameForProgress].

You may want to use this version if you want to drive the animation\n *                 from your own Animatable or via events such as download progress or a gesture.\n * @param outlineMasksAndMattes Enable this to debug slow animations by outlining masks and mattes.\n *                              The performance overhead of the masks and mattes will be proportional to the\n *                              surface area of all of the masks/mattes combined.\n *                              DO NOT leave this enabled in production.\n * @param applyOpacityToLayers Sets whether to apply opacity to the each layer instead of shape.\n *                             Opacity is normally applied directly to a shape.

The performance impact will be reduced\n *                             when hardware acceleration is enabled.\n * @param enableMergePaths Enables experimental merge paths support. Most animations with merge paths will\n *                         want this on but merge path support is more limited than some other rendering\n *                         features so it defaults to off.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases. This happens as a result of passing `progress` to `LottieAnimation`.
