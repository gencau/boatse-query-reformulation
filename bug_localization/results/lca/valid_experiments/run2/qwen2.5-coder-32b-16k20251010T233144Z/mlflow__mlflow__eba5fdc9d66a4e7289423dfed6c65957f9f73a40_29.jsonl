For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n1. Using the backend postgresql+psycopg2 (this error does not occur with sqllite)\r\n2. Run this python method with a non-string/int experiment_id:\r\n```\r\n# this gives an unexpected error and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")` where the experiment id is a non-string or integer, instead of getting an expected input validation error, the request hangs for over 60 seconds effectively making the server go unresponsive, and finally returns the error: \r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not happen using the sqllite backend. \r\n\r\nServer Error: \r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type integer: \"{'test': 'test'}\"\r\n```\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is optional -->\r\n\r\nFor bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000/\r\nArtifact URI: local-artifacts/0/68e0c4bee1a14515b03884c56e221f9b/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2:user:secret@localhost/mlflow --default-artifact-root=local-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n```\r\n# this breaks and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n1. Using the backend postgresql+psycopg2 (this error does not occur with sqllite)\r\n2. Run this python method with a non-string/int experiment_id:\r\n```\r\n# this gives an unexpected error and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")` where the experiment id is a non-string or integer, instead of getting an expected input validation error, the request hangs for over 60 seconds effectively making the server go unresponsive, and finally returns the error: \r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not happen using the sqllite backend. \r\n\r\nServer Error: \r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type integer: \"{'test': 'test'}\"\r\n```\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is optional -->\r\n\r\nFor bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000/\r\nArtifact URI: local-artifacts/0/68e0c4bee1a14515b03884c56e221f9b/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2:user:secret@localhost/mlflow --default-artifact-root=local-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n```\r\n# this breaks and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

For help with debugging your code, please refer to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\r\n\r\n**Please fill in this bug report template to ensure a timely and thorough response.**\r\n\r\n### Willingness to contribute\r\nThe MLflow Community encourages bug fix contributions. Would you or another member of your organization be willing to contribute a fix for this bug to the MLflow code base?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes. I can contribute a fix for this bug independently.\r\n- [ ] Yes. I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n1. Using the backend postgresql+psycopg2 (this error does not occur with sqllite)\r\n2. Run this python method with a non-string/int experiment_id:\r\n```\r\n# this gives an unexpected error and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")` where the experiment id is a non-string or integer, instead of getting an expected input validation error, the request hangs for over 60 seconds effectively making the server go unresponsive, and finally returns the error: \r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not happen using the sqllite backend. \r\n\r\nServer Error: \r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type integer: \"{'test': 'test'}\"\r\n```\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is optional -->\r\n\r\nFor bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000/\r\nArtifact URI: local-artifacts/0/68e0c4bee1a14515b03884c56e221f9b/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2:user:secret@localhost/mlflow --default-artifact-root=local-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n```\r\n# this breaks and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
