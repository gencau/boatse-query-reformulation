I see the error in developer console, but nothing in the UI.\r\n\r\nAbouty the tyracker problem, I'd suggest to change the `track` method like this:\r\n```kotlin\r\n// OLD (0.10.1)\r\nreturn operation().also { state.value = null } \r\n\r\n// NEW\r\nreturn try { operation() } finally { state.value = null }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI couldn't find any. Just provide some documentation and example.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMy handler looks like this. If you could show me how to display the error toast, I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval login = handle { model ->\r\n    loading.track {\r\n        if (validator.isValid(model, Unit)) {\r\n            try {\r\n                http(\"/apiIs2/authUser\")\r\n                    .acceptJson()\r\n                    .contentType(\"application/json\")\r\n                    .body(\r\n                        JSON.stringify(\r\n                            json(\r\n                                \"username\" to model.login, \"password\" to model.password\r\n                            )\r\n                        )\r\n                    )\r\n                    .post()\r\n                    .getBody()\r\n                router.navTo(\"main\")\r\n            } catch (t: Throwable) {\r\n                console.log(t)\r\n                toast { // NOT DISPLAYED :(\r\n                    content {\r\n                        alert {\r\n                            title(\"Login error\")\r\n                            content(\r\n                                if (t is FetchException && t.statusCode == 401.toShort()) {\r\n                                    \"Bad credentials\"\r\n                                } else {\r\n                                    \"$t\"\r\n                                }\r\n                            )\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        model\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/tracking/tracking.kt\",\n    \"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/remote/http.kt\",\n    \"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/history/history.kt\",\n    \"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/remote/auth.kt\",\n    \"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/remote/websocket.kt\",\n    \"headless/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/headless/foundation/focus.kt\",\n    \"core/src/jsTest/kotlin/dev/fritz2/tracking/tracking.kt\",\n    \"headless/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/headless/foundation/hooks.kt\",\n    \"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/core/store.kt\",\n    \"headless/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/headless/foundation/DatabindingProperty.kt\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/tracking/tracking.kt\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"core/src/jsMain/kotlin/dev/fritz2/tracking/tracking.kt\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "jwstegemann__fritz2__2830be2cb6cf589fc467d80d7534f48546012d69_145", "ts": "2025-10-24T11:51:18.315416+00:00"}
