The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\\n\\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\\n\\n### Expected behaviour\\n\\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\\n\\n### Actual behaviour\\n\\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\\n</bug_description>'}\n</args>\n\n\nYou have access to the following tools: \n* get_bm25_top10() -> Retrieve the top-10 best results with BM25 search. *\n* get_bm25_top20() -> Retrieve the top-20 best results with BM25 search.*\n* get_bm25_top30() -> Retrieve the top-30 best results with BM25 search. *\n\nIf you are done, provide your final ranked list of 1 files most likely to contain bugs in a JSON array as follows: {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...]}\nOtherwise, return only the tool call as JSON.
