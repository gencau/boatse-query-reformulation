If you want to render a specific\n *                 frame, you can use [LottieComposition.getFrameForProgress]. In most cases, you will want\n *                 to use one of the overloaded LottieAnimation composables that drives the animation for you.\n *                 The overloads that have isPlaying as a parameter instead of progress will drive the\n *                 animation automatically. You may want to use this version if you want to drive the animation\n *                 from your own Animatable or via events such as download progress or a gesture.\n * @param outlineMasksAndMattes Enable this to debug slow animations by outlining masks and mattes.\n *                              The performance overhead of the masks and mattes will be proportional to the\n *                              surface area of all of the masks/mattes combined.\n *                              DO NOT leave this enabled in production.\n * @param applyOpacityToLayers Sets whether to apply opacity to the each layer instead of shape.\n *                             Opacity is normally applied directly to a shape. In cases where translucent\n *                             shapes overlap, applying opacity to a layer will be more accurate at the\n *                             expense of performance.\n *                             Note: This process is very expensive. The performance impact will be reduced\n *                             when hardware acceleration is enabled.\n * @param enableMergePaths Enables experimental merge paths support. Most animations with merge paths will\n *                         want this on but merge path support is more limited than some other rendering\n *                         features so it defaults to off. The only way to know if your animation will work\n *                         well with merge paths or not is to try it. If your animation has merge paths and\n *                         doesn't render correctly, please file an issue.\n * @param renderMode Allows you to specify whether you want Lottie to use hardware or software rendering.\n *                   Defaults to AUTOMATIC.

for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB)
