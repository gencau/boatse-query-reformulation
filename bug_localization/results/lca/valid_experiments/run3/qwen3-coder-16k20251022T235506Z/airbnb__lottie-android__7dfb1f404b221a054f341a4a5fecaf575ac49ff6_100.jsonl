This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases.

This is completely unnecessary in most cases as the only actual change happens during the draw phase, not composition or layout phases. This happens as a result of passing `progress` to `LottieAnimation`. Even when using the function without progress, this happens internally reducing the scope of recomposition but not preventing it.\r\n\r\n**Steps To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. This can be reproduced with any Lottie Compose sample using Layout Inspector in Android Studio Dolphin\r\n2.
