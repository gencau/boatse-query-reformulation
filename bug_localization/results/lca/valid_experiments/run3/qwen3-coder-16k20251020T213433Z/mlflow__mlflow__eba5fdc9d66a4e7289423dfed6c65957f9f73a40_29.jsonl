I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n1. Using the backend postgresql+psycopg2 (this error does not occur with sqllite)\r\n2. Run this python method with a non-string/int experiment_id:\r\n```\r\n# this gives an unexpected error and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")` where the experiment id is a non-string or integer, instead of getting an expected input validation error, the request hangs for over 60 seconds effectively making the server go unresponsive, and finally returns the error: \r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not happen using the sqllite backend. \r\n\r\nServer Error: \r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type integer: \"{'test': 'test'}\"\r\n```\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is optional -->\r\n\r\nFor bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000/\r\nArtifact URI: local-artifacts/0/68e0c4bee1a14515b03884c56e221f9b/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2:user:secret@localhost/mlflow --default-artifact-root=local-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n```\r\n# this breaks and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.

I would be willing to contribute a fix for this bug with guidance from the MLflow community.\r\n- [x] No. I cannot contribute a bug fix at this time.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n- **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in MLflow)**:\r\n- **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)**: CentOS Linux 7\r\n- **MLflow installed from (source or binary)**: binary\r\n- **MLflow version (run ``mlflow --version``)**: mlflow, version 1.23.1\r\n- **Python version**: Python 3.9.5\r\n- **npm version, if running the dev UI**: N/A\r\n- **Exact command to reproduce**: \r\n\r\n1. Using the backend postgresql+psycopg2 (this error does not occur with sqllite)\r\n2. Run this python method with a non-string/int experiment_id:\r\n```\r\n# this gives an unexpected error and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the problem\r\nDescribe the problem clearly here. Include descriptions of the expected behavior and the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `mlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")` where the experiment id is a non-string or integer, instead of getting an expected input validation error, the request hangs for over 60 seconds effectively making the server go unresponsive, and finally returns the error: \r\n```\r\nMlflowException: API request to http://localhost:5000/api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create failed with exception HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/2.0/mlflow/runs/create (Caused by ResponseError('too many 500 error responses'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not happen using the sqllite backend. \r\n\r\nServer Error: \r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.DataError: (psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation) invalid input syntax for type integer: \"{'test': 'test'}\"\r\n```\r\n### Tracking information\r\n\r\n<!-- This section is optional -->\r\n\r\nFor bugs related to the tracking features (e.g. mlflow should log a run in my database but it doesn't), please insert the following code in your python script / notebook where you encountered the bug and run it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(\"MLflow version:\", mlflow.__version__)\r\nprint(\"Tracking URI:\", mlflow.get_tracking_uri())\r\nprint(\"Artifact URI:\", mlflow.get_artifact_uri())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, make sure the printed out information matches what you expect and paste it (with sensitive information masked) in the box below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMLflow version: 1.25.1\r\nTracking URI: http://localhost:5000/\r\nArtifact URI: local-artifacts/0/68e0c4bee1a14515b03884c56e221f9b/artifacts\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you know the command that was used to launch your tracking server (e.g. `mlflow server -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`), please provide it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmlflow server --backend-store-uri postgresql+psycopg2:user:secret@localhost/mlflow --default-artifact-root=local-artifacts --host 0.0.0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code to reproduce issue\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.\r\n```\r\n# this breaks and makes the server unresponsive for over 60 seconds\r\nmlflow.start_run(experiment_id={\"test\":\"test\"}, run_name=\"Hello World\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other info / logs\r\nInclude any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem. If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and files should be attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What component(s), interfaces, languages, and integrations does this bug affect?\r\nComponents \r\n- [ ] `area/artifacts`: Artifact stores and artifact logging\r\n- [ ] `area/build`: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\r\n- [ ] `area/docs`: MLflow documentation pages\r\n- [ ] `area/examples`: Example code\r\n- [ ] `area/model-registry`: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/models`: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\r\n- [ ] `area/projects`: MLproject format, project running backends\r\n- [ ] `area/scoring`: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\r\n- [X] `area/server-infra`: MLflow Tracking server backend\r\n- [X] `area/tracking`: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\r\n\r\nInterface \r\n- [ ] `area/uiux`: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\r\n- [ ] `area/docker`: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\r\n- [ ] `area/sqlalchemy`: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\r\n- [ ] `area/windows`: Windows support\r\n\r\nLanguage \r\n- [ ] `language/r`: R APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/java`: Java APIs and clients\r\n- [ ] `language/new`: Proposals for new client languages\r\n\r\nIntegrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/azure`: Azure and Azure ML integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/sagemaker`: SageMaker integrations\r\n- [ ] `integrations/databricks`: Databricks integrations\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\",\n    \"mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py\",\n    \"mlflow/utils/autologging_utils/safety.py\",\n    \"mlflow/pyfunc/__init__.py\",\n    \"mlflow/tracking/client.py\",\n    \"mlflow/store/model_registry/sqlalchemy_store.py\",\n    \"mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\",\n    \"mlflow/utils/rest_utils.py\",\n    \"mlflow/utils/uri.py\",\n    \"mlflow/utils/proto_json_utils.py\",\n    \"mlflow/cli.py\",\n    \"mlflow/utils/validation.py\",\n    \"mlflow/projects/databricks.py\",\n    \"mlflow/projects/__init__.py\",\n    \"mlflow/store/tracking/file_store.py\",\n    \"mlflow/sklearn/__init__.py\",\n    \"mlflow/sagemaker/__init__.py\",\n    \"mlflow/pytorch/__init__.py\",\n    \"mlflow/diviner.py\",\n    \"mlflow/spark.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\nNone\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"mlflow/tracking/fluent.py\", \"mlflow/store/tracking/sqlalchemy_store.py\", \"mlflow/tracking/client.py\", \"mlflow/tracking/_tracking_service/client.py\", \"mlflow/utils/validation.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "mlflow__mlflow__eba5fdc9d66a4e7289423dfed6c65957f9f73a40_29", "ts": "2025-10-20T21:43:50.802522+00:00"}
