Say we have a `track_file.txt`with (duplicate) tracks as below:\r\n```\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn downloading these tracks we get:\r\n```\r\n$ spotdl -l=track_file.txt -d \r\nINFO: Preparing to download 2 songs\r\n\r\nINFO: 1. Alan Walker ‒ The Spectre (Lyrics / Lyrics Video)[HD] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lPa0963LEc)\r\n\r\nINFO: 2. Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [Lyrics] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bI36Iu6M6s)\r\n```\r\n\n```\n$ cat track_file.txt\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\n\r\nspotdl internally removes the duplicates from the track file but does not rewrite the unique tracks back to `track_file.txt`. So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nspotdl/spotify-downloader\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

Say we have a `track_file.txt`with (duplicate) tracks as below:\r\n```\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn downloading these tracks we get:\r\n```\r\n$ spotdl -l=track_file.txt -d \r\nINFO: Preparing to download 2 songs\r\n\r\nINFO: 1. Alan Walker ‒ The Spectre (Lyrics / Lyrics Video)[HD] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lPa0963LEc)\r\n\r\nINFO: 2. Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [Lyrics] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bI36Iu6M6s)\r\n```\r\n\n```\n$ cat track_file.txt\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\n\r\nspotdl internally removes the duplicates from the track file but does not rewrite the unique tracks back to `track_file.txt`. So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nspotdl/spotify-downloader\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

Say we have a `track_file.txt`with (duplicate) tracks as below:\r\n```\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn downloading these tracks we get:\r\n```\r\n$ spotdl -l=track_file.txt -d \r\nINFO: Preparing to download 2 songs\r\n\r\nINFO: 1. Alan Walker ‒ The Spectre (Lyrics / Lyrics Video)[HD] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lPa0963LEc)\r\n\r\nINFO: 2. Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [Lyrics] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bI36Iu6M6s)\r\n```\r\n\n```\n$ cat track_file.txt\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\n\r\nspotdl internally removes the duplicates from the track file but does not rewrite the unique tracks back to `track_file.txt`. So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nspotdl/spotify-downloader\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

Say we have a `track_file.txt`with (duplicate) tracks as below:\r\n```\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn downloading these tracks we get:\r\n```\r\n$ spotdl -l=track_file.txt -d \r\nINFO: Preparing to download 2 songs\r\n\r\nINFO: 1. Alan Walker ‒ The Spectre (Lyrics / Lyrics Video)[HD] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lPa0963LEc)\r\n\r\nINFO: 2. Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [Lyrics] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bI36Iu6M6s)\r\n```\r\n\n```\n$ cat track_file.txt\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\n\r\nspotdl internally removes the duplicates from the track file but does not rewrite the unique tracks back to `track_file.txt`. So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nspotdl/spotify-downloader\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

Say we have a `track_file.txt`with (duplicate) tracks as below:\r\n```\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn downloading these tracks we get:\r\n```\r\n$ spotdl -l=track_file.txt -d \r\nINFO: Preparing to download 2 songs\r\n\r\nINFO: 1. Alan Walker ‒ The Spectre (Lyrics / Lyrics Video)[HD] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lPa0963LEc)\r\n\r\nINFO: 2. Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [Lyrics] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bI36Iu6M6s)\r\n```\r\n\n```\n$ cat track_file.txt\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\n\r\nspotdl internally removes the duplicates from the track file but does not rewrite the unique tracks back to `track_file.txt`. So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nspotdl/spotify-downloader\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\nspotdl/spotify-downloader\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

Alan Walker ‒ The Spectre (Lyrics / Lyrics Video)[HD] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lPa0963LEc)\r\n\r\nINFO: 2. Janji - Heroes Tonight (feat. Johnning) [Lyrics] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bI36Iu6M6s)\r\n```\r\n\n```\n$ cat track_file.txt\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3SipFlNddvL0XNZRLXvdZD\r\n```\n\r\nspotdl internally removes the duplicates from the track file but does not rewrite the unique tracks back to `track_file.txt`. So, when it successfully downloads the third track from the file in the above case, it deletes the second track instead of the third track and the third track lives on in `track_file.txt`\n\r\nI can think of three solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Fix this by filtering duplicates from track file and re-writing track file with unique tracks so that tracks from track file are deleted in proper order.\r\n\r\n- Initially creating a new list of duplicate tracks in file and then take extra care to skip this track and remove it from file if it has been already downloaded once.\r\n\r\n- Do nothing and let the script figure out on its own going with the `--overwrite` argument when the same track is being downloaded for the second time.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"spotdl/spotdl.py\",\n    \"spotdl/handle.py\",\n    \"spotdl/internals.py\",\n    \"spotdl/spotify_tools.py\",\n    \"spotdl/youtube_tools.py\",\n    \"setup.py\",\n    \"spotdl/metadata.py\",\n    \"spotdl/convert.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"spotdl/spotdl.py\", \"spotdl/handle.py\", \"spotdl/internals.py\", \"spotdl/spotify_tools.py\", \"spotdl/spotdl.py\", \"spotdl/spotdl.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"spotdl/internals.py\", \"spotdl/spotdl.py\", \"spotdl/handle.py\", \"spotdl/spotify_tools.py\", \"spotdl/youtube_tools.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "spotdl__spotify-downloader__ac94cf4f3bcb071826d94346cb4b3cee7e6c897e_34", "ts": "2025-10-20T21:55:46.779263+00:00"}
