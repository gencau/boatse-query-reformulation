If these custom files are in the source directory, they are known by TeXiFy and included commands are recognized. But if these files are in a location specified by the TEXINPUTS environment variable this does not work.

RequirePackage command and align is recognized as valid environment.\r\nIf my_style.sty is in a TEXINPUTS directory, it is marked as \"not found\" and for align an error is produced: \"Environment
