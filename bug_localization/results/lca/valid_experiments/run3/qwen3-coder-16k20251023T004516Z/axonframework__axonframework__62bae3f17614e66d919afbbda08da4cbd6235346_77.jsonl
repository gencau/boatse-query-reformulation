The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\naxonframework/axonframework\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\naxonframework/axonframework\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

The health indicator starts as a spring component and injects the axon `EventProcessingConfiguration` to access the `.eventProcessors()` method to loop over all event processors checking their status.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction of our new `HealthIndicator` we started seeing random occurrences of duplicated events in our event processors. We spent the last few days tracking down the error and finally found a race condition in the initialization of the axon event processors. After looking at the axon source code we found that calling the `.eventProcessors()` was not a simple get operation (as we expected) but it actually initialized the event processors. In some rare occasions the `HealthIndicator` will call the `.eventProcessors()` method at the same time as it is being initialized by axon during startup. Since the `EventProcessingModule.initializeProcessors()` is not thread safe this will causes duplicate event processor threads being created for the same event processor and segment.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe `.eventProcessors()` method looks like a simple getter, and should not have side effects. If the initialization side effects are unavoidable it should be thread safe.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nRace condition when calling `.eventProcessors()` from multiple locations simultaneously during startup.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n
