Moving the callback call to outside of the \"if emit:\"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement? \r\n\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/axis.py\",\n    \"lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/artist.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/animation.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/cbook.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/widgets.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/projections/polar.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/backend_managers.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/_api/deprecation.py\",\n    \"galleries/users_explain/axes/constrainedlayout_guide.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/cm.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/backend_tools.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\",\n    \"galleries/examples/widgets/annotated_cursor.py\",\n    \"lib/matplotlib/ticker.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/axis.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/axis.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py\", \"lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/artist.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/animation.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/cbook.py\", \"lib/matplotlib/widgets.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 10 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "matplotlib__matplotlib__00afcc0c6d4d2e4390338127f05b8f4fdb4e7087_141", "ts": "2025-10-09T05:23:15.580385+00:00"}
