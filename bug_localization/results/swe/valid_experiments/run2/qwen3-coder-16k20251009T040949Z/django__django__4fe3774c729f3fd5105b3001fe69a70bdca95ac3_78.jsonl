This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n# ...

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n# ...
