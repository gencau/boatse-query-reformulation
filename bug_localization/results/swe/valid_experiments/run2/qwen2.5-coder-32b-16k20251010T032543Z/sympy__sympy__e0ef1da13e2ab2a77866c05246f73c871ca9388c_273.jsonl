Theoretical background:\n==========================\nConsider the polynomials f, g in Z[x] of degrees deg(f) = n and\ndeg(g) = m with n >= m.\n\nDefinition 1:\n=============\nThe sign sequence of a polynomial remainder sequence (prs) is the\nsequence of signs of the leading coefficients of its polynomials.\n\nSign sequences can be computed with the function:\n\nsign_seq(poly_seq, x)\n\nDefinition 2:\n=============\nA polynomial remainder sequence (prs) is called complete if the\ndegree difference between any two consecutive polynomials is 1;\notherwise, it called incomplete.\n\nIt is understood that f, g belong to the sequences mentioned in\nthe two definitions above.\n\n1A. Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Theoretical background:\n==========================\nConsider the polynomials f, g in Z[x] of degrees deg(f) = n and\ndeg(g) = m with n >= m.\n\nDefinition 1:\n=============\nThe sign sequence of a polynomial remainder sequence (prs) is the\nsequence of signs of the leading coefficients of its polynomials.\n\nSign sequences can be computed with the function:\n\nsign_seq(poly_seq, x)\n\nDefinition 2:\n=============\nA polynomial remainder sequence (prs) is called complete if the\ndegree difference between any two consecutive polynomials is 1;\notherwise, it called incomplete.\n\nIt is understood that f, g belong to the sequences mentioned in\nthe two definitions above.\n\n1A. Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Theoretical background:\n==========================\nConsider the polynomials f, g in Z[x] of degrees deg(f) = n and\ndeg(g) = m with n >= m.\n\nDefinition 1:\n=============\nThe sign sequence of a polynomial remainder sequence (prs) is the\nsequence of signs of the leading coefficients of its polynomials.\n\nSign sequences can be computed with the function:\n\nsign_seq(poly_seq, x)\n\nDefinition 2:\n=============\nA polynomial remainder sequence (prs) is called complete if the\ndegree difference between any two consecutive polynomials is 1;\notherwise, it called incomplete.\n\nIt is understood that f, g belong to the sequences mentioned in\nthe two definitions above.\n\n1A. Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...
