When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available ​here):\ndjango.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq\" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.\nIt looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.\nI tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.\nI searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on ​django-users and was asked to report this here.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\",\n    \"django/apps/registry.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/oracle/creation.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0001_initial.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/state.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/checks.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0008_alter_user_username_max_length.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0004_alter_user_username_opts.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/writer.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\",\n    \"django/apps/config.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0002_alter_permission_name_max_length.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/graph.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/features.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/gis/utils/layermapping.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0010_alter_group_name_max_length.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py\", \"django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py\", \"django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py\", \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\", \"django/apps/registry.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\", \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\", \"django/db/migrations/graph.py\", \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0001_initial.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 10 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__08a4ee06510ae45562c228eefbdcaac84bd38c7a_15", "ts": "2025-10-21T19:21:26.701087+00:00"}
