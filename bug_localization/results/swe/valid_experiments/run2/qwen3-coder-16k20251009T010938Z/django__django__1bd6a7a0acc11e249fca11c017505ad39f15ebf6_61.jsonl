However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests.

However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests.

This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.\nI have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/utils.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/options.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/migrations/0001_initial.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/related.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/flatpages/migrations/0001_initial.py\",\n    \"docs/conf.py\",\n    \"django/forms/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/redirects/migrations/0001_initial.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/sites/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/redirects/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/migrations/0001_initial.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/contenttypes/migrations/0001_initial.py\",\n    \"django/apps/config.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/files.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/contrib/admin/options.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/utils.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/contrib/admin/options.py\", \"django/contrib/admin/helpers.py\", \"django/db/models/options.py\", \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\", \"django/forms/models.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__1bd6a7a0acc11e249fca11c017505ad39f15ebf6_61", "ts": "2025-10-09T01:32:24.377377+00:00"}
