I think it can be understood just by inspecting the code so I'm going to describe it while I have it in mind.\nSetting serialized_rollback = True on a TransactionTestCase triggers ​rollback emulation. In practice, for each database:\nBaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db calls connection._test_serialized_contents = connection.creation.serialize_db_to_string()\nTransactionTestCase._fixture_setup calls connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)\n(The actual code isn't written that way; it's equivalent but the symmetry is less visible.)\nserialize_db_to_string orders models with serializers.sort_dependencies and serializes them. The sorting algorithm only deals with natural keys. It doesn't do anything to order models referenced by foreign keys before models containing said foreign keys. That wouldn't be possible in general because circular foreign keys are allowed.\ndeserialize_db_from_string deserializes and saves models without wrapping in a transaction. This can result in integrity errors if an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references. I'm suggesting to fix it as follows:\ndiff --git a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\nindex bca8376..7bed2be 100644\n--- a/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n+++ b/django/db/backends/base/creation.py\n@@ -4,7 +4,7 @@ import time\n from django.apps import apps\n from django.conf import settings\n from django.core import serializers\n-from django.db import router\n+from django.db import router, transaction\n from django.utils.six import StringIO\n from django.utils.six.moves import input\n \n@@ -128,8 +128,9 @@ class BaseDatabaseCreation(object):\n\t\t the serialize_db_to_string method.\n\t\t \"\"\"\n\t\t data = StringIO(data)\n-\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n-\t\t\tobj.save()\n+\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\tfor obj in serializers.deserialize(\"json\", data, using=self.connection.alias):\n+\t\t\t\tobj.save()\n \n\t def _get_database_display_str(self, verbosity, database_name):\n\t\t \"\"\"\nNote that loaddata doesn't have this problem because it wraps everything in a transaction:\n\tdef handle(self, *fixture_labels, **options):\n\t\t# ...\n\t\twith transaction.atomic(using=self.using):\n\t\t\tself.loaddata(fixture_labels)\n\t\t# ...\nThis suggest that the transaction was just forgotten in the implementation of deserialize_db_from_string.\nIt should be possible to write a deterministic test for this bug because the order in which serialize_db_to_string serializes models depends on the app registry, and the app registry uses OrderedDict to store apps and models in a deterministic order.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py\",\n    \"django/core/serializers/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/features.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\",\n    \"django/forms/models.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/deletion.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/core/management/commands/loaddata.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__b330b918e979ea39a21d47b61172d112caf432c3_35", "ts": "2025-10-09T23:28:16.426412+00:00"}
