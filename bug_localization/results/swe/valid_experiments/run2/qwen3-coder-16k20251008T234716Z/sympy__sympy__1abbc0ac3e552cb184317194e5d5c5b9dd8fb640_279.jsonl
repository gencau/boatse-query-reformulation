Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"sympy/physics/units/__init__.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/definitions/unit_definitions.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/systems/length_weight_time.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/util.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/definitions/__init__.py\",\n    \"sympy/solvers/solvers.py\",\n    \"sympy/matrices/matrices.py\",\n    \"sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\",\n    \"sympy/solvers/solveset.py\",\n    \"sympy/core/expr.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\",\n    \"sympy/matrices/decompositions.py\",\n    \"sympy/geometry/line.py\",\n    \"sympy/core/function.py\",\n    \"sympy/core/numbers.py\",\n    \"sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py\",\n    \"sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py\",\n    \"sympy/solvers/ode/ode.py\",\n    \"sympy/crypto/crypto.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\nNone\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"sympy/physics/units/__init__.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "sympy__sympy__1abbc0ac3e552cb184317194e5d5c5b9dd8fb640_279", "ts": "2025-10-09T01:04:24.196086+00:00"}
