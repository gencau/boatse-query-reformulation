When the contents of\nchildren change, their parents are automatically invalidated.  The\nnext time an invalidated transform is accessed, it is recomputed to\nreflect those changes.  This invalidation/caching approach prevents\nunnecessary recomputations of transforms, and contributes to better\ninteractive performance.\n\nFor example, here is a graph of the transform tree used to plot data\nto the graph:\n\n.. image:: ../_static/transforms.png\n\nThe framework can be used for both affine and non-affine\ntransformations.  However, for speed, we want to use the backend\nrenderers to perform affine transformations whenever possible.\nTherefore, it is possible to perform just the affine or non-affine\npart of a transformation on a set of data.  The affine is always\nassumed to occur after the non-affine.  For any transform::\n\n  full transform == non-affine part + affine part\n\nThe backends are not expected to handle non-affine transformations\nthemselves.\n\nSee the tutorial :ref:`transforms_tutorial` for examples\nof how to use transforms.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Note: There are a number of places in the code where we use `np.min` or\n# `np.minimum` instead of the builtin `min`, and likewise for `max`.
