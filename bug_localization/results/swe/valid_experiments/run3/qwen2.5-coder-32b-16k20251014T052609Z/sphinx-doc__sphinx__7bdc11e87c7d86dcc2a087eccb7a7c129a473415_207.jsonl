If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.\r\n\r\n\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/apidoc.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\",\n    \"sphinx/domains/cpp.py\",\n    \"sphinx/domains/c.py\",\n    \"doc/usage/extensions/example_google.py\",\n    \"doc/usage/extensions/example_numpy.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py\",\n    \"sphinx/domains/javascript.py\",\n    \"sphinx/locale/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/application.py\",\n    \"sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/theming.py\",\n    \"sphinx/util/inspect.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py\",\n    \"sphinx/addnodes.py\",\n    \"sphinx/environment/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/doctest.py\",\n    \"sphinx/domains/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/pycode/parser.py\",\n    \"sphinx/ext/intersphinx.py\",\n    \"sphinx/parsers.py\",\n    \"sphinx/writers/text.py\",\n    \"sphinx/util/docutils.py\",\n    \"sphinx/builders/__init__.py\",\n    \"sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py\",\n    \"sphinx/cmd/build.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py\", \"sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py\", \"sphinx/ext/apidoc.py\", \"sphinx/application.py\", \"sphinx/util/inspect.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "sphinx-doc__sphinx__7bdc11e87c7d86dcc2a087eccb7a7c129a473415_207", "ts": "2025-10-14T09:26:15.542231+00:00"}
