If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/base.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/query.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/graph.py\",\n    \"django/db/utils.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\nNone\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928_88", "ts": "2025-10-21T22:54:33.122317+00:00"}
