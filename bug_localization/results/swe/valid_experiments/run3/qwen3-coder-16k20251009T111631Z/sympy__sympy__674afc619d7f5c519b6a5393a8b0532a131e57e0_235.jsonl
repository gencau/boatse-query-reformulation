We summarize here\nthe gist of it.\n\nAll functions are sorted according to how rapidly varying they are at\ninfinity using the following rules. Any two functions f and g can be\ncompared using the properties of L:\n\nL=lim  log|f(x)| / log|g(x)|           (for x -> oo)\n\nWe define >, < ~ according to::\n\n    1. f > g .... L=+-oo\n\n        we say that:\n        - f is greater than any power of g\n        - f is more rapidly varying than g\n        - f goes to infinity/zero faster than g\n\n    2. f < g .... L=0\n\n        we say that:\n        - f is lower than any power of g\n\n    3. f ~ g .... L!=0, +-oo\n\n        we say that:\n        - both f and g are bounded from above and below by suitable integral\n          powers of the other\n\nExamples\n========\n::\n    2 < x < exp(x) < exp(x**2) < exp(exp(x))\n    2 ~ 3 ~ -5\n    x ~ x**2 ~ x**3 ~ 1/x ~ x**m ~ -x\n    exp(x) ~ exp(-x) ~ exp(2x) ~ exp(x)**2 ~ exp(x+exp(-x))\n    f ~ 1/f\n\nSo we can divide all the functions into comparability classes (x and x^2\nbelong to one class, exp(x) and exp(-x) belong to some other class). In\nprinciple, we could compare any two functions, but in our algorithm, we\ndon't compare anything below the class 2~3~-5 (for example log(x) is\nbelow this), so we set 2~3~-5 as the lowest comparability class.\n\n# ...

We summarize here\nthe gist of it.\n\nAll functions are sorted according to how rapidly varying they are at\ninfinity using the following rules. Any two functions f and g can be\ncompared using the properties of L:\n\nL=lim  log|f(x)| / log|g(x)|           (for x -> oo)\n\nWe define >, < ~ according to::\n\n    1. f > g .... L=+-oo\n\n        we say that:\n        - f is greater than any power of g\n        - f is more rapidly varying than g\n        - f goes to infinity/zero faster than g\n\n    2. f < g .... L=0\n\n        we say that:\n        - f is lower than any power of g\n\n    3. f ~ g .... L!=0, +-oo\n\n        we say that:\n        - both f and g are bounded from above and below by suitable integral\n          powers of the other\n\nExamples\n========\n::\n    2 < x < exp(x) < exp(x**2) < exp(exp(x))\n    2 ~ 3 ~ -5\n    x ~ x**2 ~ x**3 ~ 1/x ~ x**m ~ -x\n    exp(x) ~ exp(-x) ~ exp(2x) ~ exp(x)**2 ~ exp(x+exp(-x))\n    f ~ 1/f\n\nSo we can divide all the functions into comparability classes (x and x^2\nbelong to one class, exp(x) and exp(-x) belong to some other class). In\nprinciple, we could compare any two functions, but in our algorithm, we\ndon't compare anything below the class 2~3~-5 (for example log(x) is\nbelow this), so we set 2~3~-5 as the lowest comparability class.\n\n# ...

We summarize here\nthe gist of it.\n\nAll functions are sorted according to how rapidly varying they are at\ninfinity using the following rules. Any two functions f and g can be\ncompared using the properties of L:\n\nL=lim  log|f(x)| / log|g(x)|           (for x -> oo)\n\nWe define >, < ~ according to::\n\n    1. f > g .... L=+-oo\n\n        we say that:\n        - f is greater than any power of g\n        - f is more rapidly varying than g\n        - f goes to infinity/zero faster than g\n\n    2. f < g .... L=0\n\n        we say that:\n        - f is lower than any power of g\n\n    3. f ~ g .... L!=0, +-oo\n\n        we say that:\n        - both f and g are bounded from above and below by suitable integral\n          powers of the other\n\nExamples\n========\n::\n    2 < x < exp(x) < exp(x**2) < exp(exp(x))\n    2 ~ 3 ~ -5\n    x ~ x**2 ~ x**3 ~ 1/x ~ x**m ~ -x\n    exp(x) ~ exp(-x) ~ exp(2x) ~ exp(x)**2 ~ exp(x+exp(-x))\n    f ~ 1/f\n\nSo we can divide all the functions into comparability classes (x and x^2\nbelong to one class, exp(x) and exp(-x) belong to some other class). In\nprinciple, we could compare any two functions, but in our algorithm, we\ndon't compare anything below the class 2~3~-5 (for example log(x) is\nbelow this), so we set 2~3~-5 as the lowest comparability class.\n\n# ...
