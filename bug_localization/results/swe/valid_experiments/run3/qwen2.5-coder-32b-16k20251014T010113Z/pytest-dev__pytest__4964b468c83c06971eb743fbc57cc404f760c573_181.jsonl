I found that the user name returned by `getpass.getuser()` may return characters that are not allowed for directory names. This may lead to errors while creating the temporary directory.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I reproduced this issue was while being logged in through an ssh connection into my Windows 10 x64 Enterprise version (1909) using an OpenSSH_for_Windows_7.7p1 server. In this configuration the command `python -c \"import getpass; print(getpass.getuser())\"` returns my domain username e.g. `contoso\\john_doe` instead of `john_doe` as when logged in regularly using a local session.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to create a temp directory in pytest through e.g. `tmpdir_factory.mktemp('foobar')` this fails with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/john_doe/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-contoso/john_doe')\r\nmode = 511, parents = False, exist_ok = True\r\n\r\n    def mkdir(self, mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Create a new directory at this given path.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        if self._closed:\r\n            self._raise_closed()\r\n        try:\r\n>           self._accessor.mkdir(self, mode)\r\nE           FileNotFoundError: [WinError 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\john_doe\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-contoso\\\\john_doe'\r\n\r\nC:\\Python38\\lib\\pathlib.py:1266: FileNotFoundError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could also reproduce this without the complicated ssh/windows setup with pytest 6.2.2 using the following commands from a `cmd`:\r\n```bat\r\necho def test_tmpdir(tmpdir):>test_tmp.py\r\necho   pass>>test_tmp.py\r\nset LOGNAME=contoso\\john_doe\r\npy.test test_tmp.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for having a look at this!\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/pytester.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/config/__init__.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/main.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/_code/code.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/hookspec.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/junitxml.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/python.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/config/findpaths.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/python_api.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/terminal.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/fixtures.py\",\n    \"doc/en/conf.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/compat.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/reports.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/cacheprovider.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/logging.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/outcomes.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/monkeypatch.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/capture.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/doctest.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/runner.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/nodes.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/_argcomplete.py\",\n    \"scripts/release-on-comment.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/mark/expression.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/helpconfig.py\",\n    \"src/_pytest/mark/structures.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\", \"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"src/_pytest/config/findpaths.py\", \"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"src/_pytest/config/__init__.py\", \"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\", \"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"src/_pytest/tmpdir.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "pytest-dev__pytest__4964b468c83c06971eb743fbc57cc404f760c573_181", "ts": "2025-10-14T03:50:04.729208+00:00"}
