In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/core/files/storage.py\",\n    \"django/conf/global_settings.py\",\n    \"django/core/files/uploadedfile.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/finders.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\",\n    \"django/core/files/uploadhandler.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/templates.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/file.py\",\n    \"django/http/multipartparser.py\",\n    \"django/apps/registry.py\",\n    \"django/core/exceptions.py\",\n    \"django/http/request.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/sites.py\",\n    \"django/forms/fields.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/management/commands/collectstatic.py\",\n    \"django/utils/autoreload.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/management/__init__.py\",\n    \"docs/conf.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/oracle/creation.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/makemessages.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/options.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/hashers.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/backends.py\",\n    \"django/core/files/move.py\",\n    \"django/utils/archive.py\",\n    \"django/utils/translation/trans_real.py\",\n    \"django/http/response.py\",\n    \"django/apps/config.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/core/files/storage.py\", \"django/core/files/uploadhandler.py\", \"django/core/files/storage.py\", \"django/core/files/move.py\", \"django/core/files/storage.py\", \"django/core/files/storage.py\", \"django/core/files/storage.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/core/files/storage.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 1 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__e7fd69d051eaa67cb17f172a39b57253e9cb831a_6", "ts": "2025-10-14T01:07:08.324352+00:00"}
