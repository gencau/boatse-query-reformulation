(Knuth notes that multiset\npartitions can be thought of as partitions of vectors of integers,\nwhere the ith element of the vector gives the multiplicity of\nelement i.)\n\nThe values a, b and c are *components* of the multiset.  These\ncorrespond to elements of a set, but in a multiset can be present\nwith a multiplicity greater than 1.\n\nThe algorithm deserves some explanation.\n\nThink of the part aaabc from the multiset above.  If we impose an\nordering on the components of the multiset, we can represent a part\nwith a vector, in which the value of the first element of the vector\ncorresponds to the multiplicity of the first component in that\npart. Thus, aaabc can be represented by the vector [3, 1, 1].  We\ncan also define an ordering on parts, based on the lexicographic\nordering of the vector (leftmost vector element, i.e., the element\nwith the smallest component number, is the most significant), so\nthat [3, 1, 1] > [3, 1, 0] and [3, 1, 1] > [2, 1, 4].  The ordering\non parts can be extended to an ordering on partitions: First, sort\nthe parts in each partition, left-to-right in decreasing order. Then\npartition A is greater than partition B if A's leftmost/greatest\npart is greater than B's leftmost part.  If the leftmost parts are\nequal, compare the second parts, and so on.\n\nIn this ordering, the greatest partition of a given multiset has only\none part.  The least partition is the one in which the components\nare spread out, one per part.\n\n# ...

It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing.
