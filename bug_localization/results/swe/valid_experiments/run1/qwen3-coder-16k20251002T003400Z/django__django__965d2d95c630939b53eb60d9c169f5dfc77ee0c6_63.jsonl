Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\",\n    \"django/utils/autoreload.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/__init__.py\",\n    \"django/core/handlers/asgi.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\",\n    \"django/core/handlers/exception.py\",\n    \"django/core/checks/model_checks.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/utils/log.py\",\n    \"django/middleware/csrf.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/signals.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/deletion.py\",\n    \"django/template/base.py\",\n    \"django/apps/registry.py\",\n    \"django/core/servers/basehttp.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/query.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\n    \"django/core/handlers/base.py\",\n    \"django/core/files/uploadhandler.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", \"django/db/models/signals.py\", \"django/core/handlers/exception.py\", \"django/utils/log.py\", \"django/template/base.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__965d2d95c630939b53eb60d9c169f5dfc77ee0c6_63", "ts": "2025-10-02T00:57:25.764225+00:00"}
