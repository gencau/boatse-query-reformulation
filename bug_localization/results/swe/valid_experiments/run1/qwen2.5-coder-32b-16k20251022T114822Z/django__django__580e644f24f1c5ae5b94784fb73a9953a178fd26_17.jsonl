When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.\nThis problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.\nThis can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:\ndef render(self, context):\n\turl = self.url(context)\n\t# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME'] \n\tif self.varname is None:\n\t\treturn url\n\tcontext[self.varname] = url\n\t\treturn ''\nOn more research I found that FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage ignores SCRIPT_NAME as well. \nWe might have to do a lot of changes but I think it's worth the efforts.\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/templatetags/static.py\",\n    \"django/conf/global_settings.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/sites.py\",\n    \"django/template/defaulttags.py\",\n    \"django/core/handlers/wsgi.py\",\n    \"docs/conf.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\",\n    \"django/forms/widgets.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\",\n    \"django/urls/base.py\",\n    \"django/views/generic/base.py\",\n    \"django/views/static.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_list.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/templates.py\",\n    \"django/templatetags/i18n.py\",\n    \"django/views/generic/edit.py\",\n    \"django/template/base.py\",\n    \"django/middleware/csrf.py\",\n    \"django/core/files/storage.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\",\n    \"django/core/checks/urls.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/management/commands/collectstatic.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/files.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/flatpages/templatetags/flatpages.py\",\n    \"django/utils/autoreload.py\",\n    \"django/template/loader_tags.py\",\n    \"django/http/response.py\",\n    \"django/urls/resolvers.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/staticfiles/finders.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/templatetags/static.py\", \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", \"django/core/handlers/wsgi.py\", \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/templatetags/static.py\", \"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", \"django/core/handlers/wsgi.py\", \"django/conf/global_settings.py\", \"django/core/files/storage.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__580e644f24f1c5ae5b94784fb73a9953a178fd26_17", "ts": "2025-10-22T12:05:46.412796+00:00"}
