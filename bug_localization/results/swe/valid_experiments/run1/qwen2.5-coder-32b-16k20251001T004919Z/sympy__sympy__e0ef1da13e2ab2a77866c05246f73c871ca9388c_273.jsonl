Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...

Euclidean and subresultant prs's:\n=====================================\nThe subresultant prs of f, g is a sequence of polynomials in Z[x]\nanalogous to the Euclidean prs, the sequence obtained by applying\non f, g Euclid's algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisors\n(gcd) in Q[x].\n\nThe subresultant prs differs from the Euclidean prs in that the\ncoefficients of each polynomial in the former sequence are determinants\n--- also referred to as subresultants --- of appropriately selected\nsub-matrices of sylvester1(f, g, x), Sylvester's matrix of 1840 of\ndimensions (n + m) * (n + m).\n\nRecall that the determinant of sylvester1(f, g, x) itself is\ncalled the resultant of f, g and serves as a criterion of whether\nthe two polynomials have common roots or not.\n\n# ...
