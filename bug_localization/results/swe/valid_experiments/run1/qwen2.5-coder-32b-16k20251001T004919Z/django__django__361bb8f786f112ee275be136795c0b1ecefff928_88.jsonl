We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

Start by analyzing the issue description and then decide which tool to use first.\nIf you are done, provide your final ranked list of 10 files most likely to contain bugs in a JSON array as follows: {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...]}\nOtherwise, return only the tool call as JSON.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug. Returns a JSON object with explanation, relevant code snippets, error messages and file paths mentioned in the bug. *\n\nYou must use these tools to find 10 files that are most likely to contain the bug. Start by analyzing the issue description and then decide which tool to use first.\nIf you are done, provide your final ranked list of 10 files most likely to contain bugs in a JSON array as follows: {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...]}\nOtherwise, return only the tool call as JSON.

We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/base.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\",\n    \"django/db/utils.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/query.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/operations/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/graph.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\",\n    \"django/conf/global_settings.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/related.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/questioner.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/manager.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/features.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/operations.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/options.py\",\n    \"django/core/management/commands/flush.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/base.py\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"django/db/backends/base/creation.py\", \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\", \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\", \"django/db/models/base.py\", \"django/core/management/base.py\", \"django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 10 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__361bb8f786f112ee275be136795c0b1ecefff928_88", "ts": "2025-10-01T02:36:36.965775+00:00"}
