Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\",\n    \"sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py\",\n    \"sklearn/ensemble/forest.py\",\n    \"sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py\",\n    \"sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/stochastic_gradient.py\",\n    \"sklearn/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/coordinate_descent.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/passive_aggressive.py\",\n    \"examples/ensemble/plot_ensemble_oob.py\",\n    \"sklearn/gaussian_process/gpc.py\",\n    \"sklearn/ensemble/weight_boosting.py\",\n    \"sklearn/kernel_approximation.py\",\n    \"sklearn/neighbors/nca.py\",\n    \"sklearn/externals/joblib/parallel.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/perceptron.py\",\n    \"sklearn/decomposition/dict_learning.py\",\n    \"sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py\",\n    \"sklearn/mixture/bayesian_mixture.py\",\n    \"sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py\",\n    \"sklearn/tree/tree.py\",\n    \"sklearn/svm/classes.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/sag.py\",\n    \"sklearn/feature_selection/rfe.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py\",\n    \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\",\n    \"sklearn/mixture/base.py\",\n    \"sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py\",\n    \"sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/forest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/base.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/forest.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/base.py\", \"sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_forest.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "scikit-learn__scikit-learn__3aefc834dce72e850bff48689bea3c7dff5f3fad_193", "ts": "2025-10-01T13:35:15.364989+00:00"}
