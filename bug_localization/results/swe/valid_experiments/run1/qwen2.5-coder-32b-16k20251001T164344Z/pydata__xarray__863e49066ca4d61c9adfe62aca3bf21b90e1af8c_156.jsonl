Several users (@raj-kesavan, @richardotis, now myself) have wondered about how to concatenate xray Datasets with different variables. With the current `xray.concat`, you need to awkwardly create dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that don't have them (or drop mismatched variables entirely). Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user. This would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\"}\n</args>\n\nYou have access to the following tools: \n* get_bm25_top10() -> Retrieve the top-10 best results with BM25 search. *\n* get_bm25_top20() -> Retrieve the top-20 best results with BM25 search.*\n* get_bm25_top30() -> Retrieve the top-30 best results with BM25 search. *\n \nIf you are done, provide your final ranked list of 1 files most likely to contain bugs in a JSON array as follows: {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...]}\nOtherwise, return only the tool call as JSON.
