Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).\n\n\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"xarray/core/variable.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/dataset.py\",\n    \"xarray/backends/api.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/dataarray.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/computation.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/combine.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/groupby.py\",\n    \"xarray/backends/zarr.py\",\n    \"versioneer.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/alignment.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/merge.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/concat.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/common.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/resample.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/indexing.py\",\n    \"xarray/backends/file_manager.py\",\n    \"xarray/core/ops.py\",\n    \"xarray/plot/plot.py\",\n    \"xarray/conventions.py\",\n    \"setup.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"xarray/core/concat.py\", \"xarray/core/concat.py\", \"xarray/core/dataset.py\", \"xarray/core/combine.py\", \"xarray/core/merge.py\", \"xarray/core/concat.py\", \"xarray/core/concat.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"xarray/core/concat.py\", \"xarray/core/dataset.py\", \"xarray/core/combine.py\", \"xarray/core/merge.py\", \"xarray/backends/api.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "pydata__xarray__863e49066ca4d61c9adfe62aca3bf21b90e1af8c_156", "ts": "2025-10-21T11:47:10.729058+00:00"}
