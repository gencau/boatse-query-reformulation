The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n</bug_description>\n\nThe repository name is:\n<repo_name>\ndjango__django__453967477e3ddae704cd739eac2449c0e13d464c\n</repo_name>\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n* extract_relevant() -> Retrieve the most relevant info from the bug.

I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n</bug_description>\n\nBM25 retrieved the following files:\n<bm25_retrieved>\n{\n  \"files\": [\n    \"django/db/models/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/options.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/state.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\n    \"django/forms/models.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/related.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\",\n    \"django/core/serializers/base.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/query.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/models.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/auth/base_user.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/contenttypes/fields.py\",\n    \"django/views/generic/dates.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/features.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/fields/files.py\",\n    \"django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/oracle/operations.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/deletion.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\",\n    \"django/apps/registry.py\",\n    \"django/db/backends/base/schema.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/utils.py\",\n    \"django/db/models/manager.py\",\n    \"django/core/serializers/xml_serializer.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\",\n    \"django/contrib/gis/utils/layermapping.py\"\n  ]\n}\n</bm25_retrieved>\n\nYou have also viewed the following files during your investigation:\n<viewed_files>\n[\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"django/db/models/base.py\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"django/db/models/options.py\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\"]\n</viewed_files>\n\n\n This is the final ranked list of files you provided: [\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"django/db/models/base.py\", \"django/db/models/options.py\", \"django/db/migrations/state.py\", \"django/db/models/fields/related.py\"].\n\nYou are required to return 5 files most likely to contain bugs.\n\nProvide a confidence score for each file in the list based on this rubric:\n<RUBRIC>\n9-10 (Near-certain): Direct file mention in bug description or stack frame, you have seen the file content and it matches the bug context.\n7-8 (Strong): Clear functional ownership and multiple strong signals (identifiers + behavior + BM25 retrieval).\n5-6 (Plausible): Good topical/structural match with partial identifier/behavior evidence.\n3-4 (Weak): Mostly retrieval/path proximity with little concrete alignment, no evidence.\n1-2 (Very unlikely): Invalid/irrelevant, or only superficial similarity, no evidence.\n</RUBRIC>\n\nAdjust the ranking based on your confidence scores.\nIf your confidence score is below 7 for the first 2-3 files, you should consider replacing it with a file for which you have higher confidence.\n\nYou may reply with ONE of these JSON shapes ONLY:\nA) {\"ranked_files\": [\"file1\", \"file2\", ...], \"confidence_scores\": [\"score1\", \"score2\", ...]}\nB) {\"function_call\":\"view_file\",\"args\":{\"file_path\":string}}\nNever include code blocks, file contents, or extra keys.\nIf you are about to paste file content, STOP and return JSON instead.\nReply ONLY with the required JSON format.\n\n"}], "run_id": "django__django__453967477e3ddae704cd739eac2449c0e13d464c_54", "ts": "2025-10-21T10:16:43.714906+00:00"}
